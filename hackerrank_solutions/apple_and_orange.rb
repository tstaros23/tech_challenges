#
# Complete the 'countApplesAndOranges' function below.
#
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER s
#  2. INTEGER t
#  3. INTEGER a
#  4. INTEGER b
#  5. INTEGER_ARRAY apples
#  6. INTEGER_ARRAY oranges
#

#so we have an array. [s,t] is the range where the house lies
#a is the where the apply tree lies on the array for exsmple
# we have an array of apples that include the distance they are away from the applie tree
# a = 4, s = 7, t = 10
# apple array = [2,3,-4]
# create an array from a range for the house
# iterate through apple array and add each value to the apple tree value.
# then  compare it to the house array and count each time a value in the apple array is in the range
#
